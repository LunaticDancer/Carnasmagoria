# Carnasmagoria

Carnasmagoria is an open source roguelike game made in Unity (version 2020.3.8f1).

In Carnasmagoria, you play as a sentient machine that, after a long travel through space, has landed on a planet made entirely out of living flesh. Your objective is to survive and expand.

Notes about the project structure:
- The project has only one Scene, content loading and offloading is to be entirely handled by prefabs
- The project groups resources related to a given object/piece of functionality, as opposed to following a folder structure that segregates by type

Features:
None until further development
